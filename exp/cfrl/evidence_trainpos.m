%EVIDENCE_TRAINPOS_CAT   Classifier evidence by trainpos and category.
%
%  Given EEG classifier evidence and context classifier evidence for one
%  subject, calculate mean evidence as a function of train position,
%  category type, and category. This can then be used to calculate category
%  integration rate.

%  [eeg_evid, con_evid, n] = evidence_trainpos_cat(eeg, con, category)
%
%  INPUTS
%  eeg - [trials x categories] matrix
%      Classifier evidence for EEG data.
%
%  con - [trials x categories] matrix
%      Classifier evidence for states of context from the model.
%
%  category - [lists x items] matrix
%      Stimulus category. Sorting order must match the column order in
%      eeg and con.
%
%  OUTPUTS
%  eeg_evid - [trainpos x category types] matrix
%      Classifier evidence for EEG by train position, category type
%      (current, previous, baseline), and category.
%
%  con_evid - [trainpos x category types] matrix
%      Classifier evidence statistics for context.
%
%  n - [trainpos x category types] matrix
%      Number of trials in each bin.
